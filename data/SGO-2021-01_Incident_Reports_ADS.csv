There was one passenger onboard at the time of the incident, an employee of the Jacksonville Transportation Authority. There were no reported injuries, and the vehicle was driven from the scene.
Review of the automated driving system logs as well as onboard video footage determined that the operator disengaged the automated driving system 7.5 seconds prior to the vehicle mounting the curb. Further examination of the onboard video footage noted that the operator appeared to be drowsy and inattentive prior to the incident.
Beep confirmed that the operators shift was in compliance with anti-fatigue policies for this operation. The operator was referred for a post-accident drug and alcohol testing following the incident and tested negative for any impairment. Following the conclusion of the investigation into this incident, the operator was separated from employment.",

A scooterist traveling northeastbound in the rightmost lane proceeded to pass to the right of the Waymo AV followed closely by a cyclist, and the Waymo AV shifted left towards the raised boarding island and slowed to a stop to yield to the scooterist and cyclist. A passenger car traveling behind the Waymo AV approached the Waymo AV from behind and the front of the passenger car made contact with the rear of the stationary Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage. The passenger of the Waymo AV later alleged a minor injury.

The passenger of the Waymo AV was not belted at the time of the impact because they were preparing to exit. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage. No injuries were reported.

A vehicle sensor detects a false positive as a pedestrian moving toward the May vehicles path in a region closely behind another vehicle.  This causes the May vehicle to stop to allow it to safely pass.  A following agent (still accelerating at the time of the impact) collides with the May vehicle one second after we come to a stop.  Re-simulation on newer software shows that routine software improvements resolved this issue and the commercial May software has been updated to this release.,

A vehicle travelling to the left of the May shuttle (ego) in the non-AV lane performed a right hand turn across the May vehicles path.  Given the full stopping power and the limited space with which the ego had to stop, the ego was physically unable to stop in time before impact.  The primary factor that led to this collision was human error on the part of the other vehicle that was required to yield to through traffic in the AV lane but did not.  Right turns across a straight lane are uncommon, and drivers are typically not used to them, however there are several signs that instruct other traffic to yield to the vehicles in the AV lane.  There were no autonomy faults or errors which led to this incident.",

The primary factor that led to this collision was human error on the part of the other vehicle that was required to yield to through traffic in the AV lane but did not.  Right turns across a straight lane are uncommon, and drivers are typically not used to them, however there is a metal street sign that instructs other traffic to yield to the vehicles in the AV lane.  There were no autonomy faults or errors which led to this incident.  Additionally, there is a second traffic light at this intersection that warns public drivers to yield to the AV shuttle. This light was not operating as it should during this incident. We are working with our partner to maintain the operation of this light and have implemented a mitigation policy of daily inspections of this light and implementing an AVO in service if this light is not functioning.",

A Motional AV with VIN [XXX] was operating in autonomous mode in Las Vegas, Nevada at approximately 5:06PM PT, with a safety driver at the wheel and an engineer in the front passenger seat.
The AV was traveling [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]. On the median of the road after the intersection were a series of traffic cones immediately to the AV's left. A piece of debris, which upon viewing the video recording appears to be a large garbage bag, was stuck on and hanging from the lead cone into the road. The AV perceived this debris as a road obstruction, causing the AV to brake. An SUV taxi was following the AV and made physical contact with the rear of the AV.
Following the contact, the safety driver assumed control of the vehicle and safely pulled over to a safe location to initiate Motional's incident response protocol. The rear of the AV had a minor dent less than $1000 in damage, and there were no injuries, nor were airbags deployed. Law enforcement was not contacted at the time of the incident.
Law enforcement was not contacted at the time of the incident if a police report becomes available, a copy may be provided by Motional.",
