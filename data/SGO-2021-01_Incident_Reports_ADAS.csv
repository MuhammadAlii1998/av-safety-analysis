Entries in this report are based on unconfirmed allegations:
On July [XXX], 2025, Toyota received an initial contact from the driver of a rental vehicle involved in the crash. The driver described that cruise control was engaged with lane trace assist/lane departure assist and pre-collision system turned on leading up to the crash event. The driver alleged that while driving on a highway, the lane trace assist/lane departure assist failed to engage and keep vehicle within lanes, and the PCS failed to detect the median of the freeway and slow down the vehicle before impact. The driver stated he noticed twice before the incident the lane trace assist/lane departure would keep the vehicle in the lane. The driver stated the third time, the vehicle drifted out of the lane, and the driver side of the vehicle impacted the freeway median. The driver alleged the driver assistance features did not function properly and failed to prevent the accident.
As a result of the crash, the driver alleged that: the airbags deployed there was significant damage to the front driver's side of the vehicle, including the wheel, tire, bumper, and fender one of the five occupants seated in the left rear position sustained injuries to her left rib cage that required emergency room treatment (seat belt use unknown) and the vehicle was towed from the scene and deemed a total loss. 
The driver stated the California Highway Patrol responded to the crash and provided report numbers ""NCIC - 9650"".
From Update Report (September 15, 2025): 
On August 28, 2025, Toyota completed vehicle inspection field report related to the crash event and obtained the Event Data Recorder (EDR) record. The record indicated that the vehicle's Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC) was engaged in the recorded moments leading up to the crash event. Toyota is investigating the Lane Tracing Assist (LTA) engagement status, and the timing of driver inputs related to steering, acceleration, and braking. This information will be provided in a future update. Minor revisions to information in the report fields above were made based on factual information obtained from the field report and EDR record.",

Based on available telematics, 33 seconds before the collision, the driver activated ACC. Then, 9 seconds before the collision, he activated Highway Assist. Next, 4 seconds after activating Highway Assist, the driver unbuckled his seatbelt while the vehicle was traveling 62 mph.

The subject Kia Niro is equipped with Highway Drive Assist (HDA), LFA, and SCC.

Customer reported there was a ""significant collision"", during which the airbags deployed. He confirmed that he was able to drive the vehicle away from the scene.
Customer reported sustaining injuries to his thumb and stomach ""because of [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] seat belt"" and requested warranty coverage, a vehicle replacement, and compensation. The customer confirmed they were not transported to the hospital and is not currently under any medical attention.
Kia Customer Care (""CC"") contacted customer to obtain additional information regarding the incident. Customer reported that Highway Driving Assist (HDA), Smart Cruise Control (SCC) and Lane Following Assist (LFA) were also on at the time of the incident and provided post-incident photos of the vehicle. The photos provided by the customer show damage to the center portion of the front bumper, consistent with contact against the rear tow hitch on the other vehicle which is also visible in the photos. Kia escalated the case for further review.
Kia confirmed that both SCC and LFA were engaged at the time of the crash. While the customer reported that HDA was also active, Kia confirmed that HDA was not engaged at the time of the crash. Kia also reviewed the ECU data which confirmed that the brake pedal was pressed two seconds before impact, which disengaged the SCC system. The data also indicates that the Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist (""FCA"") system detected a vehicle ahead and issued a Level 1 audible and visual warning prior to the collision. These data points suggest that the driver did not brake early or forcefully enough to avoid the collision.
The subject Kia Sportage is equipped with HDA, LFA, and Smart Cruise Control (SCC). Another name for SCC is Adaptive Cruise Control, which is how the customer refers to the system. LFA is a supplemental system that helps to detect lane markings and/or vehicles on the road and assists the driver's steering to help keep the vehicle between lanes. The functionality of LFA is contingent upon several outside factors and it is always the responsibility of the driver to safely steer the vehicle and to maintain the vehicle in its lane.
Further, post-impact drive cycle data shows no braking concerns. The vehicle was driven away from the scene without reported braking issues, and the brake system continued to function as expected.
Kia is currently working to obtain additional information to evaluate this incident.

On 6/28/24 claimant notified Nissan Consumer Affairs of an accident which reportedly occurred on 5/[XXX]/24. The claimant states that ProPilot Assist was in use and did not stop the vehicle. Claimant states he was ""prevented from braking,"" explaining that the brakes had failed. Claimant reports neck pain and a small scratch on right thumb and finger, but did not seek medical attention. Claimant stated the complaint is related to brake failure and claimant is not reporting a failure of the ProPilot Assist performance.
Nissan inspected the subject vehicle in connection with the brake failure complaint and found the vehicle's braking system to be fully functional. No related DTCs were noted. AEB warning lamp was off, indicating a fully functional system. EDR data shows the vehicle was traveling at 64.6mph prior to the brake application applied 3 seconds before time zero. Vehicle data shows that prior to impact, vehicle speed had been reduced to below 20 mph, with AEB activating max braking 0.5 second before the crash.  Of particular note, the driver was issued a citation by police for following a vehicle too closely as he was approaching an intersection with a 25 deg right hand turn and the EDR system does not record the status of PPA system. According to the vehicle investigation report, the subject vehicle was towed from the incident scene.  
Nissan denied the claim because there is no evidence of any manufacturing or product defect that would have caused or contributed to this incident.
On July 22, 2025, during review of the vehicle inspection report for this incident in preparation of Nissan's response to EA25-001, Nissan determined that this incident was reportable under the criteria of the Second Amended Standing General Order 2021-01 and is therefore submitting this 5-day and Final Report.",

On July [XXX], 2025, Toyota received an initial contact from the driver of a rental vehicle involved in the crash. The driver described that cruise control was engaged with lane trace assist/lane departure assist and pre-collision system turned on leading up to the crash event. The driver alleged that while driving on a highway, the lane trace assist/lane departure assist failed to engage and keep vehicle within lanes, and the PCS failed to detect the median of the freeway and slow down the vehicle before impact. The driver stated he noticed twice before the incident the lane trace assist/lane departure would keep the vehicle in the lane. The driver stated the third time, the vehicle drifted out of the lane, and the driver side of the vehicle impacted the freeway median. The driver alleged the driver assistance features did not function properly and failed to prevent the accident.
As a result of the crash, the driver alleged that: the airbags deployed there was significant damage to the front driver's side of the vehicle, including the wheel, tire, bumper, and fender one of the five occupants seated in the left rear position sustained injuries to her left rib cage that required emergency room treatment (seat belt use unknown) and the vehicle was towed from the scene and deemed a total loss. 
The driver stated the California Highway Patrol responded to the crash and provided report numbers ""NCIC - 9650"".",

She tried to correct the vehicle, but it fought her, went air borne, and hit trees and bushes knocking them down. Customer alleged sustaining multiple injuries and that she was transported to the hospital. Customer requested that Kia fix the problem with the vehicle, a replacement EV9, and compensation for her injuries. Customer reported that Highway Driving Assist (HDA), Smart Cruise Control (SCC) and Lane Following Assist (LFA) were on at the time of the incident.
Kia confirmed that HDA was not enabled in the 30 seconds prior to the crash, but SCC and LFA were enabled simultaneously during a 1 second period in the 20 seconds prior to crash.
The subject Kia EV9 is equipped with HDA, LFA, and SCC. LFA is a supplemental system that detects lane markings and/or vehicles on the road and assists the drivers steering to help keep the vehicle between lanes. SCC is a supplemental system that helps to detect a vehicle ahead, maintain the distance from the vehicle ahead, and set the speed. The functionality of these systems is contingent upon several outside factors, and it is always the responsibility of the driver to safely steer the vehicle and to maintain the vehicle in its lane.
Kia is working to inspect the vehicle, but has no further information at this time.",

According to the customer's statement, the vehicle was traveling at 65 MPH with Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Lane Centering (LCF) engaged. The driver alleged that the vehicle's brakes were not operating and that after a mile, she had to crash into the highway median. The frontal and side airbags deployed, and the vehicle was towed from the scene.
Subaru inspected the subject vehicle on 6/24/2025. The vehicle sustained extensive damage to the front right side. The front right wheel, tire, axle housing, brake caliper, brake rotor, axle shaft, and strut were missing. Additionally, the front right brake hose and ABS wiring harness were severed. The front right side of the radiator support was pushed rearward, resulting in contact with the front timing cover. The impact caused the timing cover to fracture, exposing the camshaft sprockets. As a result of this damage, the engine could not be started.
[REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]
Based on the vehicle inspection and the data acquired, Subaru determined that there was no abnormality with the vehicle braking system and that ADAS was not engaged within 30 seconds of the incident. The customer had manually cancelled ACC approximately 1 mile before the incident and had then likely mistakenly depressed the accelerator pedal rather than the brake pedal. The stability control system successfully reduced the vehicle's speed from 67.7 MPH to 37.9 MPH prior to impact by modulating engine power and activating ABS.",Y

Customer claimed that another vehicle was stopped at a traffic light and the subject vehicle did not slow down as expected.  Customer then attempted to disengage the ACC and manually apply the brakes, but the system failed to respond, preventing me from stopping the vehicle.  Customer added that the ACC system did not reduce speed appropriately or allow me to take manual control in [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] to avoid the crash.  Customer reported there was a significant collision, during which the airbags deployed.  He confirmed that he was able to drive the vehicle away from the scene.
Customer reported sustaining injuries to his thumb and stomach because of [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] seat belt and requested warranty coverage, a vehicle replacement, and compensation.  The customer confirmed they were not transported to the hospital and is not currently under any medical attention.
Kia Customer Care (CC) contacted customer to obtain additional information regarding the incident.  Customer reported that Highway Driving Assist (HDA), Smart Cruise Control (SCC) and Lane Following Assist (LFA) were also on at the time of the incident and provided post-incident photos of the vehicle.  The photos provided by the customer show damage to the center portion of the front bumper, consistent with contact against the rear tow hitch on the other vehicle which is also visible in the photos.  Kia escalated the case for further review. 
Kia confirmed that both SCC and LFA were engaged at the time of the crash.  While the customer reported that HDA was also active, Kia confirmed that HDA was not engaged at the time of the crash.  Kia also reviewed the ECU data which confirmed that the brake pedal was pressed two seconds before impact, which disengaged the SCC system.  The data also indicates that the Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist (FCA) system detected a vehicle ahead and issued a Level 1 audible and visual warning prior to the collision.  These data points suggest that the driver did not brake early or forcefully enough to avoid the collision.
The subject Kia Sportage is equipped with HDA, LFA, and Smart Cruise Control (SCC). Another name for SCC is Adaptive Cruise Control, which is how the customer refers to the system.  LFA is a supplemental system that helps to detect lane markings and/or vehicles on the road and assists the drivers steering to help keep the vehicle between lanes.  The functionality of LFA is contingent upon several outside factors and it is always the responsibility of the driver to safely steer the vehicle and to maintain the vehicle in its lane.
Further, post-impact drive cycle data shows no braking concerns.  The vehicle was driven away from the scene without reported braking issues, and the brake system continued to function as expected.
