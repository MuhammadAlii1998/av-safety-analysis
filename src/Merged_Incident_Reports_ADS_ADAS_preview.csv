While navigating westbound on [XXX] along a predefined route, vehicle 002B began to slowly veer towards the right curb. The vehicle eventually climbed the curb with the right front and rear wheels and the passenger-side mirror contacted a stationary light pole.
There was one passenger onboard at the time of the incident, an employee of the Jacksonville Transportation Authority. There were no reported injuries, and the vehicle was driven from the scene.
Review of the automated driving system logs as well as onboard video footage determined that the operator disengaged the automated driving system 7.5 seconds prior to the vehicle mounting the curb. Further examination of the onboard video footage noted that the operator appeared to be drowsy and inattentive prior to the incident.
Beep confirmed that the operators shift was in compliance with anti-fatigue policies for this operation. The operator was referred for a post-accident drug and alcohol testing following the incident and tested negative for any impairment. Following the conclusion of the investigation into this incident, the operator was separated from employment.", ,ADS

On August [XXX], 2025 at 4:54 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (""Waymo AV"") operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a passenger car on [XXX] at [XXX]. 
The Waymo AV was stopped in the rightmost lane facing northeast on [XXX] in a queue of traffic at the intersection with [XXX] at a location where the rightmost lane and leftmost lane are separated by a raised transit boarding island. As the queue of traffic advanced, the Waymo AV began moving forward. A scooterist traveling northeastbound in the rightmost lane proceeded to pass to the right of the Waymo AV followed closely by a cyclist, and the Waymo AV shifted left towards the raised boarding island and slowed to a stop to yield to the scooterist and cyclist. A passenger car traveling behind the Waymo AV approached the Waymo AV from behind and the front of the passenger car made contact with the rear of the stationary Waymo AV. At the time of the impact, the Waymo AV's Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. Both vehicles sustained damage. The passenger of the Waymo AV later alleged a minor injury.
